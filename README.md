# Enfaria

Enfaria is a work-in-progress singleplayer game inspired by Stardew Valley. It is currently in a very early phase of development and as such, any information put here would quickly become obsolete.

For the old multiplayer version, switch to branch `multiplayer`.

## Dependencies

You need the SDL2.0 development libraries installed, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries).
